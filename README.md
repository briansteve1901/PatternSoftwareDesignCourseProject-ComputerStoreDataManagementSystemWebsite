My friends and I created this project to fulfill Pattern Software Design Course Project at my university. 
Computer Store Data Management System Website is a web-based data management system for computer stores. 
This system has the Create Feature, Read Feature, Update Feature, and Delete Feature for data such as product, 
customer, supplier, staff, goods purchases, sales of goods, and payment types. We did this project to help people 
to manage their computer store data. In this project, we faced a little difficulty in implying Domain Driven Design 
Concept to this project. As a result, we read documentations. It was an honor to know that we have successfully 
created this project and scored a perfect one, 100 out of 100 for this project.
